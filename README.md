My program is able to successfully run a single round of scrabble (with 8 tiles) on one row of the scrabble board.
It is not able to accurately see if the word being inserted is an actual word in dictionary. It is also not able
to reset the board with a button. Once a tile is brought to the board the tile is unable to be returned to the tile 
holder, so it must be played.
